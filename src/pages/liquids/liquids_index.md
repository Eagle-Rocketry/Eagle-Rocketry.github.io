## Overview
### About Us
The Liquids subsection of Eagle Rocketry is Cal State LA's premiere development
group for bipropellant rocket engines and test hardware. Our team members come
from all academic backgrounds and all classifications and standings, working
together to achieve our goal of successfully building, hot-firing, and flying
a liquid propellant rocket engine designed entirely in-house by students.

### Team Contacts
Our subsection lead is Jordan Doose and our safety officer is [TBD]. Contact
information for both can be found below:

## Projects
Our team has numerous ongoing projects to support this goal, including:

### Project Vulcan
The primary development project of our subsection, the engine itself. Design
goals are 300 lbf thrust for a sustained burn duration of at least 5 seconds,
with actual duration likely closer to 10 or 15. Utilizing a pressure fed cycle
and kerosene/liquid oxygen propellants, along with an ablatively cooled chamber,
the Vesuvius engine will be Eagle Rocketry's first venture into liquid fueled
rocketry.

### Project E.M.B.E.R.
To support engine development, testing, and characterization, large quantities
of high-quality data on engine parameters is necessary. The collection of this
data is the job of high-speed data acquisition devices, also called DAQs.
E.M.B.E.R. (the Energetic Materials Behavior Experiment Recorder) is a modular
DAQ system designed to be as extensible as possible, to support testing as far
into the future as possible.

### Project Hercules
An engine by itself is little more than a plate of metal spaghetti, and to
support static fire testing operations, we are developing a low-cost test stand
and engine/tank support setup. By utilizing t-slot aluminum extrusion for as
much of the stand as possible, we hope to be able to reuse the stand for future
engines, and even offer testing support to our solid propulsion team.

### Project Icarus
The dream of any infant engine is to fly, and we aim to make that happen! After
initial development of the engine and supporting components, we will begin
designing a vehicle around the propulsion system to carry Cal State LA student
engineering into the sky under the power of a roaring liquid rocket engine.
Keep an eye out for this one!
