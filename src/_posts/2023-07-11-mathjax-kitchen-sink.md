# MathJax: Usage

To enable MathJax in a post or page, the quantifier `usemathjax: true` must be
included in the markdown frontmatter. After that, mathjax can be utilized by
surrounding LaTeX syntax with `$$`, like so:  

`\[\frac{a}{b}^2\cdotp\rho=c\]`

which produces

\[\frac{a}{b}^2\cdotp\rho=c\]

Happy mathing!
